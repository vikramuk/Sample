 
ISO 13485:2016
Medical devices -- Quality management systems -- Requirements for regulatory purposes
Document published on: 01-Mar-2016 (Official)
 
ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements. Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life-cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. technical support). ISO 13485:2016 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide product, including quality management system-related services to such organizations.
 
Requirements of ISO 13485:2016 are applicable to organizations regardless of their size and regardless of their type except where explicitly stated. Wherever requirements are specified as applying to medical devices, the requirements apply equally to associated services as supplied by the organization.
 
·         Clause 4: Quality Management System
·         Clause 5: Management Responsibility
·         Clause 6: Resource Management
·         Clause 7: Product Realization
·         Clause 8: Measurement, Analysis and Improvement
 
If any requirement in Clauses 6, 7 or 8 of ISO 13485:2016 is not applicable due to the activities undertaken by the organization or the nature of the medical device for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement in its quality management system. For any clause that is determined to be not applicable, the organization records the justification as described in 4.2.2.
 
ISO 13485 sets out the requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry. It has recently been revised to respond to the latest developments in quality management, technology and regulatory requirements that relate to the industry.
 
With the standard applicable to so many types of products, the revision was no easy task. A medical device is any product intended for use in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of medical conditions. They range from simple products like wound dressings to dentist chairs, cardiac pacers, life-support machines and even in vitro diagnostic reagents.
 
Improvements in the new version of the standard include broadening its applicability to include all organizations involved in the life cycle of the product, from concept to end of life, greater alignment with regulatory requirements and a greater focus on post-market surveillance including complaint handling.
 
There is also a greater emphasis on having the appropriate infrastructure, particularly for the production of sterile medical devices, and more focus on risk management.
 
Transition:
• Two years after the publication of ISO 13485:2016 all accredited certifications issued (new certifications or re-certifications) will be to ISO 13485:2016.
• Three years after publication by ISO of ISO 13485:2016, any existing certification issued to ISO 13485:2003 will not be valid.
